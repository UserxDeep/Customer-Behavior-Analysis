Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard
Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and business intelligence reporting. The goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights through structured analysis and clear visual storytelling.

The project combines Python, SQL, and BI tools to simulate a real-world analytics use case suitable for business and data analyst roles.

Dataset
Source: (Add source or description here, e.g., public dataset, company data, or simulated data)

Format: CSV / Excel / Database tables

Size: (Rows × Columns, if relevant)

Description:
The dataset contains structured data used to analyze trends, patterns, and key performance metrics relevant to the business problem.

Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn) – Data loading, EDA, and cleaning

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server) – Data querying and analysis

Power BI – Interactive dashboard and visualizations

Gamma – Presentation (PPT) creation

Jupyter Notebook – Analysis and documentation

Project Workflow
Data Loading

Imported raw data into Python using Pandas

Verified schema, data types, and initial structure

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions, trends, and correlations

Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies

Generated summary statistics and visual insights

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handled missing and duplicate values

Standardized formats and corrected data types

Created derived columns where needed for analysis

SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into relational databases

Wrote SQL queries to answer business questions

Used joins, aggregations, filters, and subqueries

Dashboard Development

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard

Included KPIs, trends, and drill-down visuals

Focused on clarity and business usability

Reporting & Presentation

Summarized insights in a structured report

Created a presentation deck using Gamma for storytelling

Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides:
